# Projects
## Writing
I started getting into writing in 2019. Since then, I've set up multiple publishing channels for my various writing projects:
- Non-fiction essays on [my Medium page](https://okjuan.medium.com/).
- Creative writing on [my Substack page](https://okjuan.substack.com/).
- Mini-essays and musings on [How To](https://okjuan.github.io/howto).
- Articles for [206 Zulu](https://206zulu.org/), Seattle's chapter of the [Zulu Union](https://www.thezuluunion.com/). I published [my first article](https://www.206zulu.org/station-space-breaks-ground-at-king-street-station/) in November '22.

## Coding
- [Music Lib Bot](https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot): a suite of tools for managing my music library on Spotify.
- (past) [Song Scrounger](https://github.com/okjuan/song-scrounger): a program that generates Spotify playlists from text. Now subsumed into Music Lib Bot.
- (past) [Muze Player](https://github.com/okjuan/muze): a Spotify web player that lets you steer song recommendations based on music metadata like acousticness, instrumentalness, popularity, etc.

## Music
- (past) In high school, I got into making hip hop beats and posting them on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/baba-guano). (That was the first step on the path that led me to studying Computer Science in university.)
