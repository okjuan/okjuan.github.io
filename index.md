Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juan.
I work as a Software Engineer on Microsoft Loop.
I love software, music, books, soccer, writing, coffee, & many other things.

I was born in Mexico City and grew up there playing soccer obsessively.
The summer I turned eleven, my family moved to the suburbs of New York and three years later we moved to Vancouver Island.

During high school, I learned to play guitar, began writing songs, and learned to [make beats](https://soundcloud.com/baba-guano) using Maschine MK2 by Native Instruments.
My new obsession led me to enroll in [Music & Computer Science](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/music/undergrad/programs/mtech/index.php), an unusual "combined major" at the University of Victoria, with aspirations to learn how to record and produce music.
But my plans were derailed by the discovery of my new obsession: [programming](https://okjuan.me/vbook/career).

My [career began](https://okjuan.me/vbook/career-2) with Software Engineering co-ops at local companies in Victoria, which then led me to an internship at Microsoft in the summer of 2018 and a fulltime position starting in September of 2019.
Discontentment at my first role at Microsoft and spare time at home during the Covid-19 pandemic [spurred me](https://okjuan.me/vbook/boredom) to pursue personal projects in programming [related t](https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot)[o music](https://github.com/okjuan/muze-radio) and in writing, a latent interest of mine.

I started posting essays on [Medium](https://okjuan.medium.com/) and [Substack](https://okjuan.substack.com/), and even wrote [a short piece](https://www.206zulu.org/station-space-breaks-ground-at-king-street-station/) as a volunteer for [206 Zulu](https://www.206zulu.org/), the Seattle chapter of the Zulu Union.
My writing endeavors have culminated so far in [okjuan.me/vbook](https://okjuan.github.io/vbook), which is also a [programming project](https://github.com/okjuan/vbook).
It's like a blog, more [like a digital garden](https://okjuan.me/vbook/what), but I call it a [virtual book](https://okjuan.me/vbook/virtual-book).
It has [many inspirations](https://okjuan.me/vbook/come-up-with-ideas) and it's [still evolving](https://okjuan.me/vbook/what-2).

Writing as a craft was not the only fruit borne out of my early discontent at Microsoft.
After an unhappy first year, I sought out an internal transfer and eventually landed in Excel, where I worked contentedly for a year and a half.
Then came the opportunity to join Microsoft Loop, a brand new and exciting Office app.
I was intrigued by how Loop was reimagining the collaborative document on principles similar to those of my [then-burgeoning idea](https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360) of a virtual book.
I spoke with managers from several teams and eventually got my top choice, working on Loop's collaborative canvas and text editor.
In this new job I had a feeling I had never had.
_I could see myself working on this for years._
I have been working happily on Microsoft Loop since early 2022.

I'm on an indefinite hiatus from making music, but I still continuously make playlists [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/jcgalleg).
In life in general, [this is what I'm up to now](https://okjuan.me/vbook/now).
