# My Projects
## Writing
I started getting into writing in 2019. Since then, I've set up multiple publishing channels for my various writing projects:
- [Medium](https://okjuan.medium.com/): non-fiction essays.
- [Substack](https://okjuan.substack.com/): creative writing.
- [How To](https://okjuan.github.io/howto): mini-essays & musings.
- [206 Zulu](https://www.206zulu.org/author/juan-carlos-gallegos/): articles for Seattle's chapter of the [Zulu Union](https://www.thezuluunion.com/).

## Coding
- [Music Lib Bot](https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot): a suite of tools for managing my music library on Spotify.
- [Song Scrounger](https://github.com/okjuan/song-scrounger) (*past*): a program that generates Spotify playlists from text. Now subsumed into Music Lib Bot.
- [Muze Player](https://github.com/okjuan/muze) (*past*): a Spotify web player that lets you steer song recommendations based on music metadata like acousticness, instrumentalness, popularity, etc.

## Music
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/jcgalleg): I've spent a good deal of time making Spotify playlists since 2015 or so.
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/baba-guano) (*past*): in high school, I got into making hip hop beats. This hobby put me on an indirect path to studying Computer Science in university.
