# Why the website?

Ever since my friend Nick recommended [Confessions of a Necromancer](http://hintjens.com/blog:125) to me a few years ago, I've hungered for more like it.

Not blogs about software engineering, but blogs about the life of people with careers in software.

Recently been finding some good ones, like [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/) and [Derek Sivers' blog](https://sive.rs/).

I craved my own Now Page.

I also crave something like Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes.

I don't have a clear and distinct reason for this website.

But I can try to find one.

I can't offer the things these other authors can, because I'm much younger and have much less experience.

But, for that same reason, I can offer things _they_ cannot.

I'm early enough in my career that my thoughts might be valuable to others also in the early stages of their professional life.

My thoughts might also be useful to university students that are preparing for looking past graduation and wondering what they will do.

Or perhaps teenagers who are beginning to wonder what they will study in university, what they're going to do when they finish high school.

Or even still, maybe kids browsing the web, looking around and absorbing stuff they don't even know how to use yet.
