# Why the website?

Ever since my friend Nick recommended [Confessions of a Necromancer](http://hintjens.com/blog:125) to me a few years ago, I've hungered for more like it.

Not blogs about software engineering, but blogs about the lives of people with careers in software.

Recently been finding some good ones, like [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/on-parenthood/) and [Derek Sivers' blog](https://sive.rs/).

I started craving my own [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about), even though I don't have people hassling me about what I'm up to.

I'd already been craving public [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) like Andy Matuschak's.

Both those are just inspirations, not reasons for this website.

So, why the website?

I figure it might be interesting for others to read.

For the same reason I love memoirs, I love knowing what people are up to.

How do people live their lives?

Am I missing out on something?

What lessons can I learn from people who have had to learn them [the hard way](https://sive.rs/mistake)?

I'm young, so my library of life lessons is sparse.

But my thoughts might be valuable --

To others also in the early stages of their professional life.

To university students who wonder what they will do after graduation.

To teenagers wondering what to study in university, what to do when they finish high school.

To kids browsing the web, looking around and absorbing stuff they don't know how to use yet.
