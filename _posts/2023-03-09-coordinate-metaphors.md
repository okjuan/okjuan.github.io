It's important to keep your metaphors from bumping into one another.

Take this passage from Oliver Burkeman's book [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals]():
> ...most of us were raised [to] prioritize future benefits over current enjoyments. But ultimately it backfires. It **wrenches** us out of the present, leading to a life spent **leaning** into the future, worrying about whether things will work out...

If we are `wrenched` out of the present, how are we only `leaning` into the future?
Wouldn't we be `thrown` into it?

To coordinate these two metaphors, we need to change the word `wrenches` or the word `leaning`.
(Or both.)
The image of being `wrenched out of the present` is vivid, but I find the image of `leaning into the future` more precise.

Burkeman could've chosen a word other than `wrenches` to lead better into the image of `leaning`.
Possibilities include: `pushes`, `nudges`, `tips`, `pulls`, `shifts`.
We are not limited to physicality, either: action words like `coaxes` and `lures` are also viable.

We can't use `leads` because that would clash with `leading` in the second part of the sentence:

> It leads us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future

Hm, it's actually not as bad as I expected.
Still, not quite right.
What if we prune `leading` out of the second part of the sentence?

> It leads us out of the present, into a life spent leaning into the future

Now I feel a bit of tension around the comma.
You can hear a touch of awkwardness when you read it aloud to yourself.

> It leads us out of the present and into a life spent leaning into the future

Is that better?
