It's important to pay close attention to how your metaphors interact when placed next to one another.
Only then can you prevent them from bumping into one another.

Take this passage from Oliver Burkeman's book [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals]():
> ...most of us were raised [to] prioritize future benefits over current enjoyments. But ultimately it backfires. It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future, worrying about whether things will work out...

If we are *wrenched* out of the present, how are we only *leaning* into the future?
Wouldn't we be thrown into it?

To coordinate these two metaphors, we need to change the word `wrenches` or the word `leaning`.
The image of being `wrenched out of the present` is vivid, but I find the image of `leaning into the future` more precise.

I think Burkeman should've replaced `wrenches` with a word that leads better into the image of `leaning`.
Possibilities include: `pushes`, `nudges`, `tips`, `pulls`. Others are `coaxes`, `lures`.

Which one of these flows more nicely?
> It wrenches us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future...

> It pulls us out of the present, leading to a life spent leaning into the future...
