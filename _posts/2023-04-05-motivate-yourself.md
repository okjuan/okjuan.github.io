The idea is that, through sheer thinking, you can mobilize a body sapped of motivation.
Willpower is like the secret gas in your car hiding below the Empty mark on the fuel gauge.
Except it never runs out.
Mind over matter.

But isn't the heroic surge of energy released from this secret mental trapdoor merely motivation?
Sure, you've had to rummage for it and claw it out, but what is it if not motivation?
