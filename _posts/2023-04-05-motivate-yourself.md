The idea is that, through sheer thought, you can mobilize a body sapped of motivation.
Willpower is like [the secret gas](https://youtu.be/TuEdU_lrtZk) in your car that hides below the E on the fuel gauge.
Except it never runs out.
Mind over matter.

But isn't the heroic surge of energy released from this secret mental trapdoor merely motivation?
Sure, you've had to rummage for it and claw it out, but what is it if not motivation?
